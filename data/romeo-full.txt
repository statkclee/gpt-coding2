But soft what light through yonder window breaks
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou her maid art far more fair than she
Be not her maid since she is envious
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it cast it off
It is my lady O it is my love
O that she knew she were
She speaks yet she says nothing what of that
Her eye discourses I will answer it
I am too bold tis not to me she speaks
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
Having some business do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return
What if her eyes were there they in her head
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand
O that I were a glove upon that hand
That I might touch that cheek
Ay me
She speaks
O speak again bright angel for thou art
As glorious to this night being oer my head
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy pacing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air
O Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo
Deny thy father and refuse thy name
Or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love
And I will no longer be a Capulet
Tis but thy name that is my enemy
Thou art thyself though not a Montague
What is Montague it is nor hand nor foot
Nor arm nor face nor any other part
Belonging to a man O be some other name
What is in a name that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet
So Romeo would were he not Romeo called
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title Romeo doff thy name
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself
